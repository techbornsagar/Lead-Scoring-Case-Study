# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
## Objective
Industry professionals can purchase online courses from X Education, a company that provides education. Several experts who are interested in the courses visit their website on any given day and search for courses. On numerous websites and search engines like Google, the firm advertises its courses. When arriving at the website, these visitors may browse the courses, submit a form for the course, or watch some videos. These persons are categorised as leads when they fill out a form with their phone number or email address. Also, the business receives leads from earlier recommendations. Employees from the sales team begin calling, sending emails, etc. as soon as these leads are obtained. Many of the leads are not transformed during this process, but some are. Over 30% of leads are typically converted at X Education. However, despite receiving a large number of leads, X Education has a relatively low lead conversion rate. For instance, if they gather 100 leads in a day, only approximately 30 of them will ultimately be converted. The organisation wants to find the most promising leads, commonly referred to as "Hot Leads," in order to improve the efficiency of this procedure. y are successful in locating this group of leads, the lead conversion rate ought to increase since the sales staff will be concentrating more on contacting the potential leads rather than calling everyone. Assign each of the leads a lead score between 0 and 100 using a logistic regression model, which the business can use to target potential leads. A higher number indicates that the lead is hot, or highly likely to convert, whereas a lower value indicates that the lead is cool, or almost certainly not going to convert. You will also need to deal with some additional issues that the firm has raised and that your model should be prepared to address if the company's requirements change in the future. These issues are offered in a different doc file. Please complete it using the logistic regression model you obtained in step one. Moreover, be sure to mention this in the section of your final PowerPoint where you offer advice.
